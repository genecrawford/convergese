        <p>Typically if you volunteer for one of the three to four days of ConvergeSE, you may attend the rest of the conference for free. Depending on the type of volunteer assignment you pick you may attend the paid workshops as well if you choose.</p>
							<p>We'll get back with you in the coming weeks on specific opportunities you may sign up for.</p>

							<p>*For those volunteering 8+ hours in return for a conference badge, your badge is good for standing room in all classes and workshops that are full.</p>
