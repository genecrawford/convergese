        <h2>The Short Story - TL;DR</h2>
							<p>Converge is for everyone who works on or with the web to make a living. From designers, developers, front-end engineers, marketers, business leaders, start up companies, film producers/directors and the old and new school creative types. Everyone can learn and level up their skills at Converge.</p>
							<h2>The Long Version</h2>
							<p>Converge was born 7+ years ago in Columbia, South Carolina as an effort to bring together disparate meetups and groups. We came together in a single day with each group being represented by a single speaker who shared his or her passion and taught us something that they knew. Sharing is caring! Fast forward to today and Converge is a multi-track, multi-day event that takes place in the historic and happening Vista, SC drawing in people from all across the United States and other continents.</p>
							
							<h2>Scope</h2>
							<p>Converge has specific training in the form of keynote sessions & in-depth workshops in:</p>
							<ul>

            <p>One of the best things about working in our industry is that itâ€™s full of very smart people, but some subjects take longer to learn no matter how smart the student. Workshops are long form educational opportunities about technical subjects taught by the best educators our industry has to offer.</p>
