		<h2>The Short Story - TL;DR</h2>
							<p>Converge is for everyone who works on or with the web to make a living. From designers, developers, front-end engineers, marketers, business leaders, start up companies, film producers/directors and the old and new school creative types. Everyone can learn and level up their skills at Converge.</p>
							<h2>The Long Version</h2>
							<p>Converge was born 7+ years ago in Columbia, South Carolina as an effort to bring together disparate meetups and groups. We came together in a single day with each group being represented by a single speaker who shared his or her passion and taught us something that they knew. Sharing is caring! Fast forward to today and Converge is a multi-track, multi-day event that takes place in the historic and happening Vista, SC drawing in people from all across the United States and other continents.</p>
